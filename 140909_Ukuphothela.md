# Ukuphothela (2014)

Ukuphothela means "beadwork" in the Ndebele language. Traditional patterns, or the vast accumulations of objects or colors were considered to have the function of repelling evil spirits all over the world. I think these patterns are representation of the light.
All details of this piece were determined by the pitch-tracking data of a recording of traditional Japanese folk song. This is an experiment to generate many patterns by various ways from one melody.
